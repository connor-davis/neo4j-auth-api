# Neo4J Auth Api

#### What is this?
This is a test to see how working with Neo4J and my skills on api development would go. My answer is that it worked out well even though there were many things I had to change up to suit the use of a graph database.

#### How to run it?
- Clone the repository ```git clone https://github.com/connor-davis/neo4j-auth-api```
- Run ```yarn or npm install```
- Build css files ```yarn run build:css```
- Spin up the server with ```yarn start```

Once that is done, access the api docs from ```printedurl/api/v1/docs```
